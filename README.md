- 👋 Hi, I’m @themowery1984
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and working remotely.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, HTML5, and CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at this point.  Maybe later, once I have an increased knowledge base.
- 📫 How to reach me:  through my profile only, at this point.  May change once I'm more familiar with all this.
